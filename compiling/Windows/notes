Download RTools
----------------
  RTools contains the Windows Toolchain and Build
  Utilities to compile R, such as
   - make,
   - bash,
   - sed
   
 
PATH must be modified to point to RTools
  (Also possible in .Renviron file in Documents folder:
     PATH="C:\Rtools\bin;${PATH}"
     
    
$(WIN)   
------
   Is set by R to either 32 or 64.

$(BINREF)
---------
   By default, R looks for compilers in the default installation path in
   C:\Rtools\. If you install Rtools anywhere else, you have to point R 
   to the path of gcc, g++, ld, by setting a variable called BINPREF.
   For example:
       BINPREF="M:/R/Rtools-3.5/mingw_$(WIN)/bin/"
       
Other tools
-----------
  Apperantly, even more tools are needed to build R:
  - Recent MiKTeX + packages fancyvrb, inconsolata, epsf, mptopdf, url
  - Inno Setup to build the installer
  - Perl such as Strawberry Perl
