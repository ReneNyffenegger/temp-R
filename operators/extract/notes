  There are four forms of the extract operator in R:
    [
    [[
    $
    @   ( also known as the slot operator)

The slot operator is used to extract content from objects built with the S4
object system, also known as a formally defined object in R.

The most important distinction between [, [[ and $ is that the [ can select more than one element whereas the other two select a single element. 

The main difference between $ and [[ is that $ does not allow computed indices, whereas [[ does. x$name is equivalent to x[["name", exact = FALSE]].
